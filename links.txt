Tensorboard Docs (Logs model's performance at each timestep) (Mostly just use to look at graphs of model performance, not the other fancy features)

Hyperparameter Optimization (Used to find best hyperparameters for specified model given a metric)

# I use mainly the raytune library to do any optimization. Not neccesary for you to learn. Also it is very picky how it's installed. Must be on Python 3.8 or lower.
